# Views and Layouts

A layout defines a single UI in your app. In Android, all UIs are built using a heirarchy of `View` and `ViewGroup` objects. A `View` usually draws something the user can see and interact with like a `TextView`, `ImageView` , or `Button`, whereas a `ViewGroup` is an invisible container that defines a layout structure for other `View` and `ViewGroup` objects. Examples of `ViewGroup`s are `LinearLayout`, `RelativeLayout`, and `ConstraintLayout`.
